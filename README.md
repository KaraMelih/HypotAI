# HypotAI: Artificial Idiocy
*``Simplicity is overrated''* <br>
Melih Kara


**HypotAI** is a parody AI project born out of the relentless hype to apply "artificial intelligence" to every imaginable problem — including those with **simple, exact solutions**.

Why use the Pythagorean theorem when you can waste compute, overfit models, and deploy regressors in production?

This project proudly embraces **Artificial Idiocy**:  
a satire of machine learning maximalism, where we throw neural networks at right triangles and celebrate the illusion of intelligence.

> **Motto:** *Maximum Effort for Minimum Insight.*

We train models to approximate what a calculator already knows — just because we can.

## Features

- Generate millions of triangle sides for a problem solved in ~500 BCE
- Predict hypotenuses with machine learning instead of math
- Explore the limits of overengineering
- Possibly misuse LLMs to describe basic geometry
- Plot things. Because plots make it look scientific™

---

## Coming Soon

- A chat interface to "reason" about triangles using a large language model
- Real-time dashboards nobody asked for
- CI/CD for deploying nonsense at scale

**Disclaimer:**  
This project is intentionally inefficient, unnecessary, and proud of it.

- minor edits for testing - adding few words
